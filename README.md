# Resume Builder

#Background
The purpose of this "Resume Builder" program is to provide users with the ability to:
1. Create one JSON file that contains all resume information, e.g. employment history, education, etc.
2. Take that JSON and produce one of several different resumes from the information contained in it, e.g. if you want to build one resume highlighting one set of experiences, and another resume highlighting a different set of experiences.


#Using the program
To use this program:
1. Create a JSON file like the one included here, and replace the existing content with your own content. Note that as-is, there are only two options: a "PM" resume and a "Dev" resume. You can add additional options by adding a third key value pair.

2.
