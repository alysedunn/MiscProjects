#Resume Builder!

#Background
This "Resume Builder" program allows users to:
1. Create ONE file that contains everything that they may want to include on a resume. 
2. Give each line item in that file a special tag, so that if the file contains information for multiple different resumes (e.g. a Front-end developer resume and a Back-End developer resume), you can later use those tags to select a particular resume.
3. View the resume that you selected (content displayed in the terminal), and print it to a PDF.


#Using the program
1. Download the "BulkResume.json" and "resumeprogram.rb" files from this repo. None of the other files in the repo are needed for the program, but you can download the entire repo if desired (it will not negatively effect the program).
2. Create a folder on your local machine (computer) and save the two files to that folder.
3. Select the "BulkResume.json" file, and replace the existing content with your content. See the comments in the file for more detailed instructions about how to update the file with your own content.
4. Open your terminal, and cd (i.e. use the "cd" change directory command) to navigate to the folder created in step #2.
5. Enter the following command via your command line (note the spaces): <b>ruby resumeprogram.rb bulkresume.json</b>
6. Follow the prompts in the program to view, and/or print, the resume of your choice.
